# GYM TRACKER 2.0 

[DEMO](https://gym-tracker-1cf05.web.app)

I made a frontend and backend for my second gym app. The frontend is a combo of **React**, **Redux** and **Material UI**. My backend code can be found on my github.  

Note FIREBASE deprecated Node 8, at the moment this app does not work. Please refer to [OLD GYM TRACKER](https://github.com/dannyzamora/gymtracker)
